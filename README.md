# üé¨ Movie Recommender System  

This project is a **content-based movie recommender system** that suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user.  
It uses **cosine similarity** on preprocessed movie feature vectors and displays movie posters using the **TMDB API**.  
The interactive interface is built with **Streamlit**.

## üìä Data Exploration & Understanding  

1. **Dataset**  
   - We worked with a dataset of movies (movie titles, IDs, and metadata).  
   - The dataset was preprocessed and saved into two files:  
     - `movie_list.pkl` ‚Üí contains movie titles and IDs.  
     - `similarity.pkl` ‚Üí precomputed similarity matrix for fast recommendations.  

2. **Exploration Highlights**  
   - Each movie is represented by numerical vectors based on its features (genre, overview, cast, crew, keywords).  
   - Using **cosine similarity**, we can compute how close one movie is to another.  
   - Example: Movies like *Inception* are closer to *Interstellar* and *The Prestige* than to *Toy Story*.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Recommendation Works  

1. **User Input**: You select a movie from the dropdown in the Streamlit app.  
2. **Find Index**: The system locates the index of that movie in `movie_list.pkl`.  
3. **Similarity Check**: Looks up the corresponding row in `similarity.pkl` to find similar movies.  
4. **Top Results**: Picks the top 5 most similar movies.  
5. **Posters**: Fetches posters from the **TMDB API** and displays them alongside movie titles.
